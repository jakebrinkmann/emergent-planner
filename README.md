> Getting even three things done on purpose is hard enough. 

1. Start: Fill in today's date at the top of the form. Number the hours (starting at 8 if 8AM)
2. Optional: Every four hours, schedule an hour break
3. Write down 3 things. You can list up to 9 tasks (âš  Don't strain yourself!)
4. Optional: Track/Estimate time up to 4 hours using 15min boxes
5. Decide what time to do the tasks
6. Use the Note area to jot down reminders
